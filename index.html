      <h2>The Atanasoff-Berry Computer</h2>
      <p>After successfully demonstrating a proof-of-concept prototype in 1939, Professor John Vincent Atanasoffestablished the funds to construct a full-scale machine at Iowa State College. The Atanasoff- Berry Computer (ABC) was built between 1939 and 1942 by Atanasoff and graduate student Clifford Berry.  A patent dispute was arisen about the invention of the computer, but it was resolved in 1973 when one of the ENIAC designers saw the ABC shortly after it was functional. Atanasoff was declared the originator of several basic computer ideas, but the computer as a concept was declared un-patentable and thus freely open to all. A full-scale clone of the computer was constructed in 1997, which thus proves the computer functioned, like Atanasoff said it did. You can find the clone, or replica on display in the Computer History Museum.</p>

      <h2>Tons of New Systems Introduced</h2>
      <p>A variety of things were introduced in 1964. The Control Data Corporation (CDC) 6600 was one of the things introduced; performs up to 3 million instructions per second --three times faster than that of its closest competitor, the IBM 7030 supercomputer. It was the fastest computer in the world until it was surpassed by the CDC 7600 in 1968. The IBM 2315 disk cartridge was also announced. It was a 1MB disk cartridge used with the IBM 1800 and 1130 computers and was portable <q>personal storage</q> for people with small computers. Each 2315 consisted of a magnetically coated, direct access disk encased in a plastic cartridge that easily fit into built-in disk drives. IBM's 2321 Data Cell Drive was also introduced. It was announced with the System/360 mainframe computer and could hold up to 400MB. The System/360 was also a major event in computing. On April 7, IBM announced five models of System/360, spanning a 50-to-1 performance range.</p>

  <h2>Macintosh, Multimedia</h2>
  <p>In 1984, Apple commenced a commercial debut during Super Bowl XVIII on January 22, 1984 that introduced the Macintosh. The ad featured the destruction of <q>Big Brother</q> -- a veiled reference to IBM -- through the power of personal computing found in a Macintosh. At a price of $2,500, the Macintosh was the first successful mouse-driven computer with a graphical user interface and was based on the Motorola 68000 microprocessor. CD-ROMs were also introduced. A follow up of the CD (compact disk), the ROM meant <q>read-only memory</q>. CD-ROMs will remain an important adjunct to Web browsing throughout the early Web era. Flash memory was also invented in 1984 by Fujio Masuoka when he was working for Toshiba. Capable of being erased and re-programmed multiple times, flash memory quickly gained a loyal following in the computer memory industry. And Matlab (Matrix Laboratory), a high-level programming language, was released. Originally meant to help students use mathematical software, it is widely used today in many other fields.

  <h2>Apple and Microsoft Make Big Moves</h2>
  <p>In 2001, Apple opened its first stores: one in Tysons Corner, Virginia, and the same day in Glendale, California. The Apple Store not only offered Apple's products, but also software, accessories, and classes on how to use Apple software. The Mac OS X was released. It offered a more stable and reliable platform and multiple applications could be run more competently at the same time. Microsoft released the Xbox, a gaming console. Originally, they reconfigured old Dell laptops to create a Window-based video game console and built the Xbox with PC parts, including a hard drive. Seen as a major risk for a software company, the Xbox console surprisingly sold out its initial North American production run. The Xbox was praised for the high-quality graphics, which usually associated with much more powerful processors. Microsoft also released Windows XP, an operating system. XP was widely adopted by industry and persisted much longer than Microsoft planned.</p>

  <h2>Technology is Booming</h2>
  <p>In 2011, the Adobe Creative Cloud was announced. It was a subscription and cloud-based model of distribution for its major software products. <i>Acrobat, Illustrator, Dreamweaver, Photoshop,</i> and others, could be subscribed to either as a complete package or individually to suit user needs. Siri was also introduced as a built-in feature to the iPhone 4S (Apple). Siri was a voice-activated personal assistant that could perform a wide number of functions, such as giving directions and weather forecasts. In 2012, Raspberry Pi (a credit-card sized single board computer) was released as a tool to help endorse science education. Since, it was easy to use, it became popular with students and hobbyists. Over a million were sold initially, and only sold between $25 and $35. In 2013, Microsoft released the Xbox One, a better version of their Xbox, and Sony released the Playstation 4, both gaming consoles with great graphics and are still popular today. Microsoft also released Office 365 and like Creative Cloud, was subscription based. In 2015, HTML 5 was released as the new standard for markup languages. </p>
