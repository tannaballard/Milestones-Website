      <h2>The Atanasoff-Berry Computer</h2>
      <p>After successfully demonstrating a proof-of-concept prototype in 1939, Professor John Vincent Atanasoffestablished the funds to construct a full-scale machine at Iowa State College. The Atanasoff- Berry Computer (ABC) was built between 1939 and 1942 by Atanasoff and graduate student Clifford Berry.  A patent dispute was arisen about the invention of the computer, but it was resolved in 1973 when one of the ENIAC designers saw the ABC shortly after it was functional. Atanasoff was declared the originator of several basic computer ideas, but the computer as a concept was declared un-patentable and thus freely open to all. A full-scale clone of the computer was constructed in 1997, which thus proves the computer functioned, like Atanasoff said it did. You can find the clone, or replica on display in the Computer History Museum.</p>

      <h3>Tons of New Systems Introduced</h3>
      <p>A variety of things were introduced in 1964. The Control Data Corporation (CDC) 6600 was one of the things introduced; performs up to 3 million instructions per second —three times faster than that of its closest competitor, the IBM 7030 supercomputer. It was the fastest computer in the world until it was surpassed by the CDC 7600 in 1968. The IBM 2315 disk cartridge was also announced. It was a 1MB disk cartridge used with the IBM 1800 and 1130 computers and was portable “personal storage” for people with small computers. Each 2315 consisted of a magnetically coated, direct access disk encased in a plastic cartridge that easily fit into built-in disk drives. IBM’s 2321 Data Cell Drive was also introduced. It was announced with the System/360 mainframe computer and could hold up to 400MB. The System/360 was also a major event in computing. On April 7, IBM announced five models of System/360, spanning a 50-to-1 performance range.</p>
